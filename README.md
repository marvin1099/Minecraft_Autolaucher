# Minecraft_Autolauncher -- *Vivecraft_Autolauncher Rewritten*
Forked from a script by Mavi222:	
https://github.com/Mavi222/Vivecraft-autolauncher

But i basically rewrote the whole thing.	
Originaly Forked on Github:		
https://github.com/marvin1099/Minecraft_Autolaucher
	

This is autolaucher super convenient because you can launch if directly from SteamVR without taking the headset off.	
There are probably some unnecessary lines, 	
but i think ist fine you can look at it yourself its inside the AKH folder.	

After the first time setup this happens:	

	1. Launches the Minecraft launcher
	
	2. Activates the Minecraft launcher window
	
	3. Klicks on the play button on the top to clear search bar
	
	4. Klicks on the instalations button
	
	5. Klicks on the sortby button
	
	6. Klicks on the sortlastplayed or sortname botton based on yor choices
	
	7. Klicks in the search bar
	
	8. Types a profile name or a part of it based on your choises 
	
	9. Klicks on the play button on the first result

# Tutorial Section

1.

Note: You can run infinite instances by copying the script. Basically every script instance has to have a different name.

If you are not that advanced just hit enter to all the Questions.	

Exept if it ask you if you want a extra folder to be included, hit no there.

I sorted them so you use the best in my opinion		

If you do that it will start the latest Vivecraft version.	

You only need to answer answer those questions once,	

as long as you dont move the file.	

to move the file also move [here script name].txt,	

if you dont the script will create a new [here script name].txt,	

and ask you again (questions below).	


2.

If you run it first time it test for a older config file.	

The config file name is [here script name].txt 	

if there is there is a file created in a other version,	

it will ask you to delete that or stop the script.	

If you want to run that script please click ok to delete it.	

If you never had used this Launcher not you wont see that at all.	


3.

If you are a advanced user the first option is for setting up your Minecraft Lanucher location,		

if your Lanucher is installed on Drive "A:\" to "F:\" In "\Program Files" or "\Program Files (x86)",	

it will ask if you want to use that location.	

If you have multiple installations and the on you want to use meets the named criteria,		

just press no until it ask you for the right one then click yes.	

If it doesn't ask you it will show a file selection Just select the Minecraft Lanucher.	

If you want to select a Minecraft Lanucher in a another path click chancel,	

and select the Minecraft Lanucher you want to use.	


4.

In the next box type the important part of the profile name.		

For example profile name "vivecraft-1.14.4-jrbudda-4-a0",	

and "vivecraft-1.13.4-jrbudda-3-a0" type "vivecraft",	

it will start the newer or older version based on you next answers.	

If you type the exact name use the name after clicking on the profile,	

and copy the version line after the line "release", "snapshot", "old_beta", or "old_alfa"	

Then it will start this profile,

exept if there are 2 or more profiles that have the same name but have a longer name.		

You can also copy the version name fom the minecraft version folder.	

the easyest way to open this folder is by opining minecraft, the options, texturenpacks,	

clicking on the open texturenpack folder, going one back on the opened File Explorer,	

and double clicking on the version folder.	


5.

The next box shows the in Minecraft Lanucher installation sort opition setting,		

its important for the script, it almost only matters,	

if you select oldsort(cancel) in the next option because with that,	

it will just type the name you typed in the last box and sort based on your opion here	

if you use the oldsort(cancel) the setup is finished for you	


6.

In the new box it will ask you to sort by name(yes), date(no), or oldsort(cancel).	

I already said something about the oldsort(cancel) option in the last Lineblock.	

the name(yes) option wil sort by name and the date(no) option wil sort by date.		

its based on your next opition if it sorts up or down up means,		

-- -- -- --  first to last 1.14.4, 1.13.2, 1.12,	
	     
jjjj.mm.dd   first to last 2020.03.10, 2020.03.09, 2020.03.08,	

the down option is from last to first instead.	


7.

If you selected name(yes), or date(no) it will ask you for your minecraft version folder,	

as i said it will ask if the the default folder is the correct one.	

if not select the correct one like this.	

type like this "C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\versions".	

replace the %Username% with your PC Username,	

or just browse to your Minercraft Version Folder.	

in the newest version it will ask you for more folders.

if you dont want an extra folder to be included hit no.


8.

In the next and last box it will ask you to imput how long the programm waits for the Minecraft Lanucher.	

If to short it will click on nothing because the Minecraft Launcher isn't useable jet.

The default (2 Sec) shold work.	


9.

Every setting is theoretically editable inside the [here script name].ini.	

If you want you can do it but i won't explain what ist what you can try some stuff,	

or just delete the [here script name].ini file it will give you all questions again.
